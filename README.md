Hi, I'm Ibrahim M. A. Megahed, a multi-passion persion with medicne knowledge and software developing innovative skills. I've been in the tech industry since 2019, working on a wide range of projects from web applications, servers and back-end software. I speak English, Russian and Arabic as a native speaker, I'm a medical student at The Egyption Assiut National University.

With a self-taught foundation in [programming languages, frameworks, or technologies], I've honed my skills to deliver high-quality code that meets the needs of real-world applications.

I usualy build software for my self, frinds or education. When i'm not coding, you can find me learning medcine as a student-doctor, exploring open-source projects. I'm always eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals who share my passion for tech and innovation.
