I'm Ibrahim Mohamed Abdelsalam Megahed, a multi-passionate individual with software development skills. I've
been in the technology industry since 2019. I provide full-stack web apps, servers, and back-end services.
With a self-taught background in programming languages, frameworks, and technologies, I've honed my ability to
produce high-quality code that fits the requirements of real-world applications. As a native Arabic speaker, I
can also communicate in English and Russian. I am a Computer Science student at [Arab Open University](https://aou.edu.eg). I am
always happy to engage with like-minded individuals who share my enthusiasm for technology. I would like to
continue my career by working on open-source projects and SaaS solutions. My hobby is to continually learn new
things. Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat about a project idea, get feedback on my or your
code, or simply grab a cup of coffee and let's discuss the latest tech trends.
